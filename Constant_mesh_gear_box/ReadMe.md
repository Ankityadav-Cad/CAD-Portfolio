# Constant Mesh Gearbox â€“ Fusion 360 Project

## ðŸ”§ Project Overview
This project involves the complete modeling, assembly, and animation of a **Constant Mesh Gearbox** in Fusion 360. Inspired by the [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPDsY4FN2Y0), this design showcases key CAD skills like part modeling, gear alignment, mechanical joints, and motion animation.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
